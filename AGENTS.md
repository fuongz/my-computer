# Instructions for AI agents

This file tells AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, …) how to record
their work so it shows up on a **lanework** board. lanework visualizes the
`.agents/reviews/` folder in this repo as a Kanban board — the review files you
write here are exactly what the board renders.

Follow these conventions for code-related tasks, while always respecting the
user's latest explicit instructions.

## Where artifacts go

All agent working files live under `.agents/`. Use **`YYYY-MM-DD`** for every
dated filename (it sorts chronologically).

| Artifact         | Path                                      | When to write it                                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Plan             | `.agents/todo.md`                         | Before any substantial edit (3–5 concrete steps).  |
| Review checklist | `.agents/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD/NN-<slug>.md` | Behavior-changing work with real design decisions. |

For **read-only requests** (review, explanation, translation), do not create,
edit, or delete these files unless the user explicitly authorizes it.

## Review gate for behavior-changing work

Before implementing behavior-changing work, write a review checklist to
`.agents/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD/NN-<slug>.md` and wait for the user to check every
box. **Implementation starts ONLY after all gating boxes are `[x]`.**

Each checklist has a **status** — its board column:

| `status`     | Meaning                                                                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `todo`       | Plan written, boxes not all checked — awaiting review. **New checklists start here.** |
| `processing` | Approved (all gating boxes `[x]`) and being implemented.                              |
| `done`       | Shipped and verified.                                                                 |
| `dropped`    | Superseded or abandoned.                                                              |

Advancing a review is a one-line `status:` edit — the file never moves.

**Frontmatter** (the board reads these): start each file with YAML, then a
`# Review: …` heading:

```yaml
---
status: todo # todo | processing | done | dropped
assignees: ["your-github-login"]
created_at: YYYY-MM-DD 00:00:00Z # the date for this card
priority: medium # low | medium | high
tags: ["ui", "server-fn"] # short controlled vocabulary for your repo
---
```

After the frontmatter, add a short "How to review" note (flip `- [ ]` → `- [x]`,
write `> notes` under any disagreement), group checklist items by topic, and
include Context, an explicit **out of scope** section, and a **files touched**
table. Make mutually-exclusive options separate "pick ONE" boxes with a
recommendation. Treat direct user edits to the checklist as decisions.

What does **not** need a review: read-only requests, single-file obvious fixes,
or tasks where the user specified the exact shape. Those only need
`.agents/todo.md`.

## Reusable scripts

Before writing a one-off script for a mechanical task (CSV/JSON conversion,
a data reshape, a repetitive transform), check `.claude/tools/` — each
subfolder is a small script someone already wrote for exactly this kind of
job. Its `TOOL.md` frontmatter names the `runtime` and `entrypoint` to run,
e.g. `python3 main.py <args>`. Prefer running one of these over writing new
code from scratch; add a new one there yourself if the task is likely to
recur.

## Verification before done

- Never mark a task complete without proving it works. Run the project's
  typecheck/build; for behavior changes, boot the app and verify.
- If verification can't run, explain why and state the remaining risk.
- End every completed task with a **"What's next for you"** handoff (follow-up
  commands, manual checks, open decisions).
